    <h1>You Chose to Investigate the sound!</h1>
   <p>You get up from your bed. You then Walk down the hallway towards the stairs leading to the backyard. But all of a sudden you look out of the window in the hallway and see lights flashing throughout the forest behind your house. You continue to approach the backyard. You walk down the stairs, and by your surprise you see two ufo's in the distance! </p> 
    <p>Should you <a href="Run.html">Run outside and follow the ufo's?</a></p>
