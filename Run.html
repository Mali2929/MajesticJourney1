    <h1>You Chose to Run from your Backyard and Chase the Ufo's!</h1>
    <p>You run from your backyard into a track in the woods from your backyard. You whip out your phone and start trying to record this encounter. But of course, you aren't looking down at your feet while running. So you stumble on branches, which slows down your pursuit of the ufo's. Because of you stumbling you then lose track of them. You look around for a high point of view so you can scout the skies a little better. You climb up a hill but you see absolutly nothing. You are distraught and can't believe you missed this only chance to record not only one ufo but two. But suddenly you hear a loud ZOOOOUUUUMMM!!!! From this loud sound your ears pop and it leaves you unconscious due to your body going into shock. You wake up and everything seems fine and you are even breathing regularly. But you are in a different environment not known to your very eyes. And you ask yourself "Where am i?"</p>
